              A galaxy is a massive system of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter held together by gravity. These celestial structures are the building blocks of the universe, ranging in size from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands of light-years across. Galaxies can contain millions to trillions of stars, along with planets, black holes, and other celestial objects.

            <h2 class="fs-1">
              Galaxies come in various shapes and sizes:
            </h2>
            <ul class="fs-1">
              <li>Spiral Galaxies: Like our Milky Way, these have a flat disk with spiral arms and a central bulge.
              </li>
              <li>Elliptical Galaxies: Oval-shaped and composed mostly of older stars.
              </li>
              <li>Irregular Galaxies: Lack a defined shape, often appearing chaotic.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h1 style="font-family: arial">
              Within galaxies, stars form in dense regions of gas and dust. Planetary systems, like our solar system, orbit these stars. Galaxies themselves often interact, colliding and merging to form new structures over billions of years.
              Galaxies are key to understanding the universe, helping scientists explore phenomena like star formation, black holes, and dark matter.

            <h1 class="py-5" style="font-family: arial">
                Interactions between galaxies are among the most fascinating processes in the universe. When galaxies pass close to one another, their gravitational forces can distort their shapes, strip away stars, and trigger intense waves of star formation. Over time, these interactions may lead to the merging of two or more galaxies into a single, larger structure. For example, the Milky Way is on a collision course with the Andromeda Galaxy, and their eventual merger, billions of years from now, will create an entirely new galaxy
                In addition to physical interactions, galaxies are crucial in exploring some of the universe’s greatest mysteries. Dark matter, an invisible substance that makes up most of a galaxy’s mass, reveals itself through the gravitational effects it exerts on stars and gas. Studying how galaxies move and interact provides vital clues about the nature of this enigmatic material.
                Galaxies also host supermassive black holes at their centers, with masses millions or even billions of times greater than the Sun. These black holes play a significant role in regulating the growth and evolution of galaxies. The energy released by matter falling into these black holes can influence star formation and shape the galaxy's structure.
                The study of galaxies continues to expand our understanding of the cosmos, revealing how stars and planets form, evolve, and sometimes end in spectacular events like supernovae. By unraveling the history of galaxies, astronomers aim to uncover the story of the universe itself, from its origins in the Big Bang to the countless galaxies scattered across the vast expanse of space today.
