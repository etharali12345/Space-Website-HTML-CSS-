                Planets are celestial bodies that orbit stars, including our own Sun, and are defined by their ability to clear their orbital path of debris. These fascinating objects vary greatly in size, composition, and atmosphere, playing a critical role in shaping the dynamics of their respective solar systems. Planets range from rocky terrestrial worlds to massive gas giants.

              <h1 class="fs-1 fw-bold">Types of Planets</h1>
              <h2 class="fs-1">
                Planets are classified into different types based on their characteristics:
              </h2>
              <ul class="fs-1">
                <li>Terrestrial Planets: Rocky planets, like Earth, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, with solid surfaces and relatively smaller sizes.
                </li>
                <li>Gas Giants: Large planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium.
                </li>
                <li>Ice Giants: Planets like Uranus and Neptune, characterized by icy compositions and a mix of water, ammonia, and methane.
                </li>
                <li>Dwarf Planets: Small celestial bodies like Pluto that orbit the Sun but have not cleared their orbital path of other debris.
                </li>
                <li>Exoplanets: Planets orbiting stars outside our solar system, many of which are vastly different from the planets we know.
                </li>
              </ul>

                The Formation of Planets
              </h1>
              <h1 style="font-family: arial">
                Planets form from the protoplanetary disks of gas and dust surrounding young stars. Over time, particles within these disks collide and stick together, growing into larger bodies called planetesimals. These planetesimals eventually accumulate enough mass to form planets. The composition of a planet is determined by its location in the disk, with rocky planets forming closer to the star and gas or ice giants forming farther away.
                Planets are critical to the evolution of their solar systems, influencing the orbits of other bodies and potentially harboring conditions suitable for life. Their diverse environments—from Earth’s vibrant biosphere to the methane lakes of Titan—offer a glimpse into the vast possibilities of planetary systems.
              </h1>
              <h1 class="py-5" style="font-family: arial">
                Studying planets provides invaluable insights into the workings of our solar system and beyond. Observations of their atmospheres, surfaces, and interactions with their environments reveal details about their history and potential for life. Exploring exoplanets expands our understanding of how common planets like Earth might be in the universe.
                The study of planets is a journey into discovering the possibilities of life beyond our world and understanding the processes that shaped our own. Each planet tells a unique story about the universe's past and its ongoing evolution.
